    "This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling \
    and spread across the floor. The slime seeps from the shattered stone of the ceiling at a snails crawl, forming a \
    mess of dangling walls of gook. As you watch, a bit of the stuff separates from a sheet and drops to the ground \
    with a wet plop.",
    "A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly \
    blocked by portcullises. Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the floor in the room \
    against the walls. They seem in poses of repose rather than violence.",
    "The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken \
    bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone's wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass \
    are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small \
    barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish.",
    "A chill wind blows against you as you open the door. Beyond it, you see that the floor and ceiling are nothing \
    but iron grates. Above and below the grates the walls extend up and down with no true ceiling or floor within your \
    range of vision. It's as though the chamber is a bridge through the shaft of a great well. Standing on the edge of \
    this shaft, you feel a chill wind pass down it and over your shoulder into the hall beyond.",
    "Rounded green stones set in the floor form a snake's head that points in the direction of the doorway you stand \
    in. The body of the snake flows back and toward the wall to go round about the room in ever smaller circles, \
    creating a spiral pattern on the floor. Similar green-stone snakes wend along the walls, seemingly at random \
    heights, and their long bodies make wave shapes.",
    "This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which \
    stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. \
    Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone.",
    "Dozens of dead, winged beings lie scattered about the floor, each about the size of a cat. Their broken bodies \
    are batlike and buglike at the same time. Each had two sets of bat wings, a long nose like a mosquito, and six \
    legs, but many were split in half or had limbs or wings lopped off. Their forms are little more than dried husks \
    now, and there's no sign of what killed them.",
    "You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their \
    smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken a large amount of salt \
    and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor with the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, \
    someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight.",
    "A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly \
    blocked by portcullises. Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the floor in the room \
    against the walls. They seem in poses of repose rather than violence.",
    "You peer into this room and spot the white orb of a skull lying on the floor. Suddenly a stone falls from the \
    ceiling and smashes the skull to pieces. An instant later, another stone from the ceiling drops to strike the \
    floor and shatter. You hear a low rumbling and cracking noise.",
    "A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It's honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as \
    wide as your head. They seem to penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but you can't be sure \
    from your vantage point.",
    "A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and \
    its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns merrily in a wide brazier \
    the idol holds in its lap.",
    "Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you \
    can barely feel. One corner of the ceiling has a particularly large clot of webbing within which a goblin's bones \
    are tangled.",
    "This hall is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the \
    floor is sticky with dried blood. It looks like the orcs and ogres were fighting. Some side was the victor but \
    you're not sure which one. The bodies are largely stripped of valuables, but a few broken weapons jut from the \
    slain or lie discarded on the floor.",
    "A large forge squats against the far wall of this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a \
    wide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt for use in pounding out shapes in hot \
    metal. Other forge tools hang in racks nearby, and a barrel of water and bellows rest on the floor nearby.",
    "Corpses and pieces of corpses hang from hooks that dangle from chains attached to thick iron rings. Most appear \
    humanoid but a few of the body parts appear more monstrous. You don't see any heads, hands, or feet -- all seem \
    to have been chopped or torn off. Neither do you see any guts in the horrible array, but several thick leather \
    sacks hang from hooks in the walls, and they are suspiciously wet and the leather looks extremely taut -- as if \
    it's under great strain.",
    "You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and \
    each hole is roughly a foot wide. The water pours in columns that fall through similar holes in the floor, flowing \
    down to some unknown depth. Each of the eight pillars of water drops as much liquid as a stream in winter thaw. \
    The floor is damp and looks slippery.",
    "You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, \
    and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn't so inviting. The \
    floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. It looks like the room once held a bed, a desk, a \
    chest, and a chair.",
    "Several white marble busts that rest on white pillars dominate this room. Most appear to be male or female humans \
    of middle age, but one clearly bears small horns projecting from its forehead and another is spread across the \
    floor in a thousand pieces, leaving one pillar empty."
