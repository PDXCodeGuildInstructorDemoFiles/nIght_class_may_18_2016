        <p>Hello, my name is Chris Jones. I am a web developer with a burning passion for solving exciting problems to
            create cool things. I especially enjoy working with Python and Django.</p>

        <p>From a very young age I realized that I had an innate ability to troubleshoot and navigate most any problem
            involving computers. When I was 12 I leveraged that skill to teach myself how to create my first website.
            This opened up a whole new world of amazing things to discover.</p>

        <p>Later in life I decided to take it to the next level and joined PDX Code Guild to learn Python, Django, and
            sharpen my skills with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p>After completing the 3 month bootcamp I was asked to stay on as the IT Manager. I spend my time there wearing
            many hats. The most challenging yet rewording has been helping students realize their ability to create
            things that they never thought they would be able to.</p>
